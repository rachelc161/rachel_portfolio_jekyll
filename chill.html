          <h3>Chill with friends on the Shoreroad</h3>
      <div class="row about-section">
      <p>Chill Shoreroad was part of my final project for my foundation degree. Chill Shoreroad are an ice cream and sweet treats shop. I worked on this project for 5 weeks and was tasked with completing some numerous different pieces of work for the client. I created, logo, loyalty cards, social media banners, and a website.  </p>

          <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          
        <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
             
            <img class="logos" src="/img/chill_logo-01.png"></div>
                 <div class="row about-section">
                     
                     <p>This is the logo design for Chill Shoreroad. I was given the colour scheme of black, white and green. I used two typefaces that are clear and legible because this makes the logo easier to read at a glance.  <br> <br>
                     
                     I thought the best way to make this look clean and professional was to focus around the text. I kept the text in either black or white, depending on the background, and then added the green line to give that little pop of colour that the client wanted.

           <h4>Social Media Banners</h4>
      <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
      <img class="logos" src="/img/coverphotos-01.png">
          </div>
             
          
         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
            
                 <p>As a part of this project I was required to produce a series of illustrations that could be used on social media, I decided to use the buildings were Chill Shoreroad is located, I thought this would help make the banners look more personal and specific to Chill Shoreroad and not any other business.  <br> <br>
                     
                     I focused around the idea of flat design because it is simple and clean. It uses simple colours and shapes.

          <h4>Loyalty Cards</h4>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
      <img class="logos" src="/img/chill_loyalty-01.png">
          </div>
             
          
         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
                 <p>The client wanted some loyalty cards designed so that they can run a promotion which allows their customers to buy 9 coffees and get a tenth coffee free. This will help enable customers to return to Chill Shoreroad for their coffee, rather than anyone else. 
                     <br><br>
                 They also wanted to have a loyalty card for milkshakes, this was aimed more at children, but in order to create brand consistency i decided to keep the look of this card the same as the coffee card except change the icons.

          <h4>Sandwich Poster</h4>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
      <img class="logos" src="/img/chill_sandwich-01.png">
          </div>
             
          
         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
                 <p>Chill Shoreroad recently started to sell sandwiches, but this wasn't very well advertised and they felt that people didn't really know that they sold sandwiches. I was tasked with creating a sandwich poster so that they could advertise the fact that they sell sandwiches.<br><br>
                 With the help of the sandwich poster, the sales of sandwiches should increase. Similar to the banner images, I used flat design with simple colours and shapes, keeping with the brand consistency.
