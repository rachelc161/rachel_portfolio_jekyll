      <h3>Sobering moment campaign</h3>
      <div class="row about-section">
      <p> The PSNI is probably one of the most well known clients I have completed some work for. I was given very specific guidlines and was tasked with creating a series of posters/print material to try and deter young people away from drugs and alcohol.  
                <br>
                <br> The posters had to try and prevent young people from turning to drugs and alcohol to solve their problems. All the material I created had to grab the attention of the viewer and make them stop and read the information. 
                <br>
                <br> I was required to create one poster for the first meeting with the PSNI, this was to give them an idea of what my idea was and what the whole series would look like. I decided to use a series of drug and sobering moment related words to build up an image and ensure that the viewers attention was grabbed and that they could take in the message.  </p>

            <p>After I created the first poster I was asked to create some more in order to create a series of sobering moment posters that followed the same theme. 
            <br/>
                <br/>
            I delivered a presentation infront of a room full of marketing directors for the PSNI as well as many of the police officers who deal with drug related crimes. They needed to be sure that all the designs met the necessary guidlines. These posters have now been released on the PSNI social media accounts in order to help sread the word.</p>
