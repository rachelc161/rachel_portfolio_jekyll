      <h3>Trespass - Go Further</h3>
      <div class="row about-section">
      <p> Trespass are one of the leading outdoor clothing, footwear and equipment providers. they operate in the UK and have lots of stores all over, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
                <br>
                <br> In December 2016 Trespass took part in a Christmas charity weekend, I was asked to create a poster that would be displayed in the store window. This poster would advertise the charity weekend to customers and allow them to know in advance that if they shopped instore that weekend and bought a raffle ticket they could be in with the chance of winning a prize. </p>

          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">

                     <p>This is the poster I designed for the christmas charity weekend. I was tasked with making this poster look as christmassy as possible, but it must also look like it belongs to Trespass and not a general poster that could be for any store.  <br> <br>
                     
                     I went for a slightly rustic feel with the white wood in the background, and then modernised the poster by using solid colours as well as little christmas icons.
                         <br><br>
                         
                         The main element on this website is the bauble icon that is in the middle, this is one of the first things that the customer will see. I also used christmas tree leaves in the top corners of the poster. This was to try and make the poster look like it is a bauble hanging on the christmas tree.
                         <br><br>
                         
                         The rest of the poster consists of icons and simple block colours and shapes, except for the background and the tree leaves. I think that the mix between icons and actual images helps to add some depth to the poster, the background looks like it is in the distance.
