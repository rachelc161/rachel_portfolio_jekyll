      <p> I completed a project where I had to create 12 icons that were based on a topic of my choice for an audience of my choice. After thinking for a long time about what my icons were gonna be I decided that I would create my icons around the animals of the farm. I was aiming my creations at young kids who would just be getting used to what each animal is and some interesting facts about them.
                <br>
                <br>This website could be used by schools to help them teach kids all about the animals that belong on the farm and help them provide kids with little fun, interesting facts about farm animals. I hope that from this site the user can learn something new about the farm animals. I learnt somethings that I didn't know about farm animals whenever I was creating the site.
            <br><br> I wanted to make this website as easy for kids to use as possible and contain just the right amount of information that kids would need to know. </p>
