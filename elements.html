      <p> I recently completed a project that was set up with the aim of making science more enjoyable and easier for kids to understand. 
                <br>
                <br> One element of science that kids struggle with the most would be the periodic table of elements, therefore this project was set up with the hope of making learning the scientific elements easier for kids to learn and understand.<br><br>
                I decided to base my project for this around the idea of superheroes, I used five different superheroes to represent the five different elements I was trying to help kids learn. I chose five elements that I thought kids would need to know the most and would be able to recognise and understadn the best. 
            <br><br> I wanted to make this website as easy for kids to use as possible and contain just the right amount of information that kids would need to know. </p>
