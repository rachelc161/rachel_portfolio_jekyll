          <h3>Mens, Buns and Beards</h3>
      <div class="row about-section">
      <p>The Mens, Buns and Beards project is probably one of the biggest projects I have completed to date. it involved a new hipster barbershop coming to Belfast and they needed all their branding and designing completed in time for the grand opening. This project included a Logo, Poster, Menus and a Website... </p>

          <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          
        <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
             
            <img class="logos" src="/img/mbblogo.png"></div>
                 <div class="row about-section">
                     
                     <p>This is the design for the barbershop that I created. This is quite a hipster barbershop, therefore I wanted to create a logo that would appeal to the hipster audience. I decided not to include an illustration in the logo as I thought it would look cheesy and childish, and this wasn't the look I was going for.  <br> <br>
                     
                     I thought the best way to make this look clean and professional was to focus around the text. I also kept the logo in one neutral colour. I made the word 'Emporium' the main focus, hoping that people will want to find out what an emporium is.

           <h4>Posters</h4>
      <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
      <img class="logos" src="/img/poster1.png">
          </div>
             
          
         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
            
                 <p>As a part of this project I was required to produce a series of poster/flyers that could be displayed in the store window, or around the town. These would help advertise the barbershop opening dates.  <br> <br>
                     
                     I focused on a simple design for this poster, this helps the information legible and clear to the audience, and people can read the poster at a glance. 
             </p>
          </div>
          
          <hr width=1080>
          
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
      <img class="logos" src="/img/poster2.png">
          </div>
             
          
         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
                 <p>Continuing on with the simple designs i decided to add a pop of colour in this poster, using a navy and copper colour scheme makes the poster look modern, yet it stil remains clean and all the information is clear and legible.
                     <br><br>
                     This poster focuses on the use of text, it doesn't include any images or elements that could distract the viewer from not gathering all the necessary information they might need.
             </p>
          </div>
          
          <hr width=1080>
          
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
      <img class="logos" src="/img/poster3.png">
          </div>
             
          
         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
                 <p>Similar to the poster above, this poster include some colour, emerald green. I decided to use an image of a green chesterfield sofa, this is the same kind of sofa that is in the waiting room of the barbershop. I thought it was quite fitting to the hipster theme. <br><br>
                     The texture on the background allows a bit of depth to the poster and helps to create a rough, vintage feel to the poster.
