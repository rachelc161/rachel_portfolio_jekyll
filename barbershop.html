          <h3>Mens, Buns and Beards</h3>
      <div class="row about-section">
      <p>The Mens, Buns and Beards project is probably one of the biggest projects I have completed to date. it involved a new hipster barbershop coming to Belfast and they needed all their branding and designing completed in time for the grand opening. This project included a Logo, Poster, Menus and a Website... </p>

          <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          
        <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">
             
            <img class="logos" src="/img/mbblogo.png"></div>

                     <p>This is the design for the barbershop that I created. This is quite a hipster barbershop, therefore I wanted to create a logo that would appeal to the hipster audience. I decided not to include an illustration in the logo as I thought it would look cheesy and childish, and this wasn't the look I was going for.  <br> <br>
                     
                     I thought the best way to make this look clean and professional was to focus around the text. I also kept the logo in one neutral colour. I made the word 'Emporium' the main focus, hoping that people will want to find out what an emporium is.

           <h4>Posters</h4>
      <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns">

                 <p>As a part of this project I was required to produce a series of poster/flyers that could be displayed in the store window, or around the town. These would help advertise the barbershop opening dates.  <br> <br>
                     
                     I focused on a simple design for this poster, this helps the information legible and clear to the audience, and people can read the poster at a glance.

      <img class="logos" src="/img/poster2.png">
          </div>
             
          
         <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns"> 
             
                 <p>Continuing on with the simple designs i decided to add a pop of colour in this poster, using a navy and copper colour scheme makes the poster look modern, yet it stil remains clean and all the information is clear and legible.

                     This poster focuses on the use of text, it doesn't include any images or elements that could distract the viewer from not gathering all the necessary information they might need.

                 <p>Similar to the poster above, this poster include some colour, emerald green. I decided to use an image of a green chesterfield sofa, this is the same kind of sofa that is in the waiting room of the barbershop. I thought it was quite fitting to the hipster theme. <br><br>
                     The texture on the background allows a bit of depth to the poster and helps to create a rough, vintage feel to the poster.
